        <h2>Why Use LinkedIn?</h2>
        <p><span>Considering something brought you to this article, it's safe to assume that you already know that LinkedIn has a lot of potential when it comes to </span><strong>generating leads</strong><span> and connecting with your potential
            prospects. But maybe you're still not sure how to use it. If that's the case keep reading because you might find some useful information.</span></p>
        <p><span>Still, we'll throw in some numbers and facts, in case you are curious just how big this social network actually is.</span></p>
        <p><span>Since its founding in 2002, LinkedIn has grown to have 590 million users from 200 countries worldwide. 260 million log into LinkedIn every month, which is 2.5 times more than the 106 million reported in 2016. This means the
            network's growth isn't stopping any time soon. </span></p>
        <p><span>80% of B2B leads come from LinkedIn and only 13% from Twitter &amp; 7% from Facebook. Have you seen anyone put their CV on Facebook? Me neither. </span></p>
        <p><span>92% of B2B Marketers use LinkedIn for Lead Generation above all other platforms. This one speaks for itself, LinkedIn is the marketers' platform of choice.</span></p>
        <p><span>Microsoft bought LinkedIn in 2006 and paid for it the whopping $26.2 billion. If these guys think LinkedIn is worth it, who are we to argue?</span></p>
        <p><span>If you're convinced enough LinkedIn is a good place to look for your potential prospects, let's move onto the important steps that can help you in the process.</span></p>
        <h2><strong>Optimizing your LinkedIn Profile</strong></h2>
        <p><span>You can't have a half-empty profile with your work experience at this one company from 10 years ago or this one recommendation from the manager in Starbucks where you did your summer job in college. You need to put some effort in
            making your profile look good to grab the attention of your target group.</span></p>
        <h3>1. Define Your Niche.</h3>
        <p><span>This is probably the single most important thing you need to figure out: </span><strong>a well defined niche. </strong><span>This step is not directly related to your LinkedIn account, but is essential if you want to reach your
            target prospects. </span></p>
        <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>You can easily optimize your advertising by knowing exactly who you're approaching.</span></li>
          <li><span>You can scale your work more easily.</span></li>
          <li><span>You can optimize your website for search engines so your niche audience finds you.</span></li>
          <li><span>It's a lot easier to get followers when in a niche, because they believe in your credibility.</span></li>
          <li><span>It's a lot easier to scale and monetize in a niche. Once you've done your research on your niche's topics, you can easily apply them for all of your services, instead of making time for more research on more topics.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>The list on the importance of a niche can go on and on, but you get the point. Defining your niche will surely help you generate more leads from LinkedIn and generally have more success with your business. </span></p>
        <p><strong>What's a good niche?</strong></p>
        <p><span>A good niche helps you stand out, makes you memorable and separates you from the countless generalist businesses nobody has ever heard of. </span></p>
        <p><span>A &ldquo;Marketing agency&rdquo;, for example, is too generic and is hardly going to attract someone's attention, if ever. You might get a few clients here and there, but the work you do with them will be too generic as well as you
            won't have your real area of expertise. </span></p>
        <p><span>Now think about a &ldquo;Marketing agency for home builders in San Francisco area&rdquo;. This is a strong niche. If there are 1000 home builders in this area, the chances are all or most of them will find you and will know this is
            your area of expertise. And this is huge.</span></p>
        <p><strong>How to define it?</strong></p>
        <p><span>There are a few steps you can follow that can help you narrow down your niche. Even if your business is very generic, focus on one specific thing at a time in the form of a campaign and approach your target group accordingly and
            with the right content and the right message.</span></p>
        <p><span>For the purpose of this article, we'll assume that you have not yet specified your niche, so the following steps can help you do so:</span></p>
        <ol>
          <li><span>Get specific on your audience demographics - age, occupation, gender, income level.</span></li>
          <li><span>Solve your own problem: if you have a specific problem, there is the chance a lot of people have it too. So solve it with your product and become an expert on the topic. It will be easier than going after something which you
              don't care for.</span></li>
          <li><span>After all, think about your hobbies and skills. You don't want to do anything you can't imagine doing for a few years straight.</span></li>
          <li><span>Define your &ldquo;Why&rdquo;. If you've seen the famous Simon Sinek </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA"><span>speech</span></a><span>, he talks about how people don't buy what you do, they buy </span><strong>why</strong><span>
              you do it. Have a purpose and people will know it.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span>As you can see, having a niche is a </span><strong>must. </strong><span>Narrow it down as much as you can and your business will thank you.</span></p>
        <h3>2. Optimize Profile Content</h3>
        <p><span>Before connecting with people on LinkedIn, you need to make sure you have a </span><strong>strong and clear</strong><span> profile. This is your online business card and is the first thing people see when they find you. Here are a
            few important steps to follow, that help you do so.</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tagline</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>This short piece of text is the single most important part of your entire LinkedIn profile. Its purpose is to show everybody on LinkedIn exactly what you do and who you are. Without it the possible prospects would never click on
            your profile or even notice it. </span></p>
        <p><span>Make sure your tagline is nothing like &ldquo;CEO and Partner of Awesome Marketing Agency&rdquo; or &ldquo;Owner of My Awesome Business&rdquo;. Nobody cares about that. The only think people care about is how you can be useful to
            them. Focus on showing your target group what you can do for them, instead of boosting your own ego.</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Description</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>When writing your profile's description, keep one thing in mind: your profile is your sales page, not your CV. Maybe it used to be like this, but this can only get you a full time job, not a new client. People are going to find your
            profile in search of the solution of their own problems and you need to talk about that. </span></p>
        <h2><strong>Generating Leads with LinkedIn</strong></h2>
        <p><span>After your profile has been optimized, you need to find your perfect customer. If you happen to have an online clothing store but you approach somebody in the food industry, the chances you close a deal with them are close to
            non-existent.</span></p>
        <h3>1. Research Target Group</h3>
        <p><span>Because this is a process which is rather long to type out, this is a great short video to show you how to research your target group using LinkedIn Navigator. Remember, you can't approach everyone, you need to have your ideal
            prospect in mind - </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTBspmi2hYw"><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTBspmi2hYw</span></a></p>
        <h3>2. Connect Request</h3>
        <p><span>Once you've created your search query with potential prospects, you want to connect with them. This is probably the most annoying, boring and demotivating part, as you'll need to go for 100 connection requests per day if you want to
            see results. Most of them will probably ignore the request and the ones who do connect might never engage in a conversation with you. </span></p>
        <p><span>Still this part is essential, but please remember - don't use automatic tools for this. LinkedIn is working very hard to restrict any type of non-human activity on the website. If you use automatic tools, you should be aware that at
            any moment, your profile can be blocked </span><strong>permanently</strong><span> with no further explanation on their side.</span></p>
        <p><span>The connect request should be accompanied with a casual message which, listen carefully, </span><strong>does not sell</strong><span>. &ldquo;People like to buy but they don't like to be sold to&rdquo;. This message is the beginning
            of the so-called &ldquo;drip sequence&rdquo;. The message can be something like: </span></p>
        <p><em><span>&ldquo;Hi [name],</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span>I came across your profile and it seems we have a lot in common on [a topic in common] so I decided to reach out to connect.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span>[Your name],</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span>[Your tagline]&rdquo;</span></em></p>
        <p><span>It's important to always add your tagline at the end of your messages instead of a signature. If your tagline is &ldquo;I help home builders in San Francisco get to page 1 on Google&rdquo;, put it after your name. You want people to
            remember you with what you can do for them.</span></p>
        <h3>3. Thanks for Connecting Message</h3>
        <p><span>Once someone has accepted your request, which happens quite a bit if you make sure your target group research has been done correctly, send them a thank you for connecting message. Don't forget to add your tagline at the end and
            again, </span><strong>don't sell</strong><span> anything to then.</span></p>
        <h3>4. Send something useful / an article</h3>
        <p><span>If you still have no response from your connections, the next step has the purpose of giving them some value. Take a good look at this person's profile, see what their business is about, what their interests are and look for an
            interesting article you think might be useful to them. The more you engage with people in a casual, human way, the more they trust you. Nobody will ever respond to you if you just try to sell them your service right away. Your tagline
            goes at the end again.</span></p>
        <h3>5. Ask for a call</h3>
        <p><span>In this last step of the dripping sequence, you want to message your potential prospect and ask them for a call. You need to explain to them why you want to do this, still don't do a complete sales pitch, stay casual and friendly
            and emphasize the potential benefits of having a quick chat. Again, don't forget to put your tagline after your name.</span></p>
        <h3>6. View profiles</h3>
        <p><span>This part is counter intuitive, because all you do is click through the profiles of the people from your search query. That's all. This is a good tactic because then people will get a notification about who has viewed their profile.
            And if your profile is good and looks professional, and more importantly if they need a service like yours at that particular moment, they might be the ones to approach you. In this case the possibility of them becoming your clients is
            really big.</span></p>
        <h3>7. Post Content</h3>
        <p><span>The next step is something we find to be extremely important and useful, but yet very much underestimated. The following statistics will show you why that is.</span></p>
        <p><strong>Only 3 million users share content weekly. </strong><span>That's right. Out of 250 million monthly active users on LinkedIn, only 3 million share content weekly. I hope you can see how huge this is. This means 3 million users are
            getting 9 billion impressions every week. Think about this for a second and then get posting, it's extremely important.</span></p>
        <h3>8. Keep engaging</h3>
        <p><span>This step is something everyone should do according to their own goals, there is no right or wrong way to approach it. It's always a good idea to keep engaging with your connections just for the sake of it. Don't sell to them, just
            talk to them, build a relationship, and see if you can help each other. This is a very slow process and might bring you no quick leads but you're going for the long run. When you mention to someone what you do, even if they don't need
            your services right away, they are going to think about you in the future. Or they might recommend you to someone. In might be in half a year or even a year, but they are going to remember you and approach you then.</span></p>
        <h2><strong>So what's next?</strong></h2>
        <p><span>If you want to succeed with generating leads on LinkedIn, we suggest you started researching and connecting today. LinkedIn is a very powerful social network. 61 million users alone are senior level influencers and 40 million are in
            decision-making positions. LinkedIn's goal is to reach 3 billion users, so it will only get bigger and more powerful.</span></p>
        <p><span>At the end of the day LinkedIn is all about being yourself and creating personal connections. Everyone knows when the message they received is generic, impersonal or has some kind of manipulation tactic in it. And they really really
            don't like it. Be honest and don't lie to people. The ones that like you and your ideas won't need to be sold to, they will see your value.</span></p>
