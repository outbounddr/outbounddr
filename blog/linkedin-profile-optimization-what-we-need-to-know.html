        <!-- Post Content -->
        <p class="blue">This is the first article of a three-part series called &ldquo;The Ultimate Guide to LinkedIn Leads Generation&rdquo;. Every week a new article from the series will be published. If you want want to be reminded when this happens, sign up below.</p>
        <p class="blue">This week we&rsquo;ll explain how to optimize your LinkedIn profile as a business owner. So if you&rsquo;re planning on driving more leads using LinkedIn, keep reading, this article is for you.</p>
        <p>The LinkedIn community is over 546 million users now and that&rsquo;s a lot of professionals networking and sharing content. But still the majority of people don&rsquo;t yet realize the great potential of LinkedIn for finding prospects and generating leads for their businesses.</p>
        <h2>Your Profile is your Sales Page and Your Business Card</h2>
        <p><span>I&rsquo;m going to assume you&rsquo;re reading this article because your aim is to generate leads on LinkedIn for your existing business and not to find a job. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll focus on explaining how to improve your LinkedIn profile for this purpose. If that&rsquo;s not the case, you can maybe keep this information in mind for the future.</span></p>
        <p><span>To get you started, here is one thing to keep in mind at all times: </span><em><span>people you connect with, a.k.a. your potential prospects, are looking at your profile to judge if they want to do business with you.</span></em></p>
        <h2>What should my profile look like?</h2>
        <p><span>In the steps below, you&rsquo;ll find information and examples on how to improve your profile, or more specifically your tagline, picture, contact info, URL, summary and experience.</span></p>
        <h3>1. Tagline</h3>
        <p><span>If you&rsquo;ve read our introduction article <a target="_blank" href="https://leadturk.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-linkedin-leads-generation.html">The Ultimate Guide To LinkedIn Leads Generation
        </a>, you probably already know that the Tagline is the most important piece of information on your profile. It shows up when you post in the news feed, in the inbox, when people browse and find you, in the &ldquo;Recommended people to connect with&rdquo; section and &ldquo;Who has viewed my profile&rdquo;. </span></p>
        <p><span>So remember this one thing when you write it: </span><em><span>don&rsquo;t tell people about yourself, tell them what you can do for them.</span></em><span> &ldquo;CEO/founder of This Awesome Business&rdquo; won&rsquo;t do the trick.</span></p>
        <p><span>Make it about your prospects and </span><strong>make it specific for your niche</strong><span>. I can&rsquo;t stress this enough, you </span><strong>have to</strong><span> have a niche! In a future article I will write about the importance of a narrow niche and how to define yours. </span></p>
        <p><strong>For example</strong><span>: &ldquo;I help B2B companies scale their business and save money through automation&rdquo;.</span></p>
        <h3>2.Picture</h3>
        <p><span>Everybody knows that profiles without a picture are hardly noticed if ever. But how important are they really? It turns out very. In a </span><a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/march/14/linkedin-profile-photo-tips-introducing-photo-filters-and-editing"><span>blog post</span></a><span> from 2017 LinkedIn states that profiles with pictures get up to 21x more views, up to 36x more messages and hp to 9x more connection requests. So strive for a professional looking photo. There is no need to hire a photographer to take it, but look for a good quality easygoing one and make sure you smile on it. Find a simple background, so the focus stays on you. Last but not least, choose natural light. It always gives a better feeling to every picture. LinkedIn also has filters, so you can further enhance the colors before posting it to your profile.</span></p>
        <h3>3. Contact Info</h3>
        <p><span>Including your contact information might just be the last piece of convincing someone needs so they can trust your and be willing to do business with you. Add your email address, phone number and company website, so it&rsquo;s also easier to get in touch.</span></p>
        <h3>4. URL</h3>
        <p><span>Your LinkedIn URL should include your name for easy searching, like so:</span></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourname"><span>https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourname</span></a></p>
        <p><span>If you have a common name, insert your middle initial or a number, but make sure your name is in there.</span></p>
        <h3>5. Summary</h3>
        <p><span>After the first look at your profile, the people whose attention you have managed to grab with your tagline and picture will scroll down and look into your profile description. Your summary needs to focus on what you can do for your clients, </span><span>not</span><span> on your achievements or the type of person you are.</span></p>
        <p><span>HubSpot suggest that you use the 3x3 summary method - three paragraphs with three or fewer sentences each. </span></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>First paragraph:</strong><span> Reiterate your purpose from your tagline.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Second paragraph</strong><span>: Get specific about your work, who you worked with, your projects and results you&rsquo;ve achieved. Add how you achieve the mission statement in your tagline.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Third paragraph</strong><span>: Include call to action that makes it clear why and how your prospect should get in touch with you.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For example</strong><span>:</span></p>
        <p><span>&ldquo;I am passionate about helping B2B companies scale their business and save money and time by offering them automation solutions. </span></p>
        <p><span>Through a customized approach, I analyze the company&rsquo;s productivity and offer automatization solutions to reduce the workload and improve the results. I&rsquo;ve helped This Famous Company generate 345% more results along with 46% cost reduction in one year.</span></p>
        <p><span>I am dedicated to partnering with great professionals to discover how automatization can benefit their business. Contact me anytime at my.email@automationsolutions.com, or call me at 555-123-4567.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <h3>6. Visual Content</h3>
        <p><span>According to </span><a target="_blank" href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/blog/sales-reps/2018/03/why-rich-media-could-be-the-difference-maker-your-linkedin-profi"><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span> adding rich media to your content summary, which is relevant to your niche, will help you attract your potential buyers by catching their attention. This is because our brains process visuals </span><a target="_blank" href="https://policyviz.com/2015/09/17/the-60000-fallacy/">600,000x faster than text</a><span> so the chances are you will make a quick impression on everyone who views your profile.</span></p>
        <p><span>The presence of rich media can not only help others understand your company&rsquo;s proposition, but will also demonstrate your expertise as a digitally oriented professional. </span></p>
        <p><span>Before displaying the visual content in your profile, think strategically about what you want to achieve with it. You want all the pieces of visual content to compliment each other and be relevant to your potential prospects of your niche. </span></p>
        <h3>7. Experience</h3>
        <p><span>Though your experience section might look like a CV, write it with your buyer in mind. List all the positions you&rsquo;ve had which are relevant to what your core business is and describe each one with a few sentences. </span></p>
        <p><span>Make sure to list three to five major duties with bullets underneath but keep the spotlight on the results you&rsquo;ve generated. This is very important, as nobody will be particularly interested in your day to day activities, but rather in what you&rsquo;re proud of, what you have achieved. </span></p>
        <p><strong>For example</strong><span>:</span></p>
        <p><strong>BUSINESS DEVELOPER</strong></p>
        <p><em><span>Automation Solutions</span></em></p>
        <p><span>March 2012 - present</span></p>
        <p><span>I work with B2B executives to implement innovative automation solutions that drive great results. While I worked with companies of all sizes and in various niches, my focus is on the tech industry.</span></p>
        <ul>
        <li><span>Helping clients take advantage of the automatization technologies</span></li>
        <li><span>Working with different teams to ensure a smooth process</span></li>
        <li><span>Constantly achieving 200%+ results with 40%+ cost reduction</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>8. Education</h3>
        <p><span>In this section try to include no only your degrees, but also courses or certifications that you have completed. </span></p>
        <h3>9. Recommendations</h3>
        <p><span>Recommendations are the easiest way to show credibility and can be compared to online reviews that you often read before making a purchase. You want to sell yourself as a professional on LinkedIn and being recommended by other people is key. So make some time to ask people for recommendations relevant to your current business and expertise and ask them to give a unique and specific insight into your work.</span></p>
        <h3>10. Groups</h3>
        <p><span>Join all the groups relevant to your niche. This shows your prospects that you care about what they care about. Being active and posting content will also increase your chances of being noticed.</span></p>
        <p><span>Optimizing your LinkedIn profile is only the first important step in making yourself noticeable for your prospects. Stay tuned for Part 2. where you can read about How to Research and Narrow Down Your Niche and why this is extremely important for your LinkedIn Leads Generation strategy.</span></p>
